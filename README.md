### 📂 Featured Projects

🧠 [**Mental Health Demand & Supply Analysis**](https://github.com/sandhya-mgs2/Capstone-4A)  
> Collected Google Trends & AHRF data, built LSTM & ARIMA models, and created an interactive dashboard to visualize state-level service gaps.

💳 [**Credit Risk & Fraud Detection**](https://github.com/QibinHuang/credit-risk-dashboard)  
> Built XGBoost and Random Forest models on 2M+ customer records. Reduced false positives by 20% and delivered insights via Power BI.

🪐 [**Evaluating Asteroid Characteristics & Threat Classification**](https://github.com/QibinHuang/Evaluating-Asteroid-Characteristics-And-Classifying-Asteroid-Threat-On-Planet-Earth)  
> Designed and implemented a machine learning pipeline to classify near-Earth asteroids by threat level using physical and orbital features.  
> Models used: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Neural Network — because what’s cooler than using AI to assess space threats? ☄️
